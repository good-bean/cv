# CV Example for Project

### Just an example of an online CV to code along with an instructor

Here are some things we went over:
- HTML boilerplate
- Text formatting
- URLs
- Tables
- Horizontal rules
- Headings
- CSS

#### Some things that I already knew before starting and added on my own outside of instruction:

All of the above, plus:
- Alternating table rows
- Transition effects on hover
- Adding titles to links in *Hobbies*
- Probably some other things I forgot about due to them being things I just do perhaps
